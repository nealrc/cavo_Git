        <h2>Understand CAVO Comprehensive Report</h2>
<p>The CAVO comprehensive report provides a combined analysis of your test scores. The y-axis, labeled "Success Rate", is the percentage of questions answered correctly. The x-axis, with labels "Level  1-4", indicates the relative levels of difficulty of the vocabulary. Each level will have a series of bars, color-coded by type of test, corresponding to the percentage of words you've answered correctly in that level of difficulty. As you take a wider variety of tests, more and more bars will appear. To hide and unhide bars so that the comparisons between different tests can be made more easily, simply click on the test name in the graph key. </p>
<p>Two special categories, HSK and FREQ, are an approximation of how you  have scored on the vocabulary items found in the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi or the frequency standardized vocabulary databases. This number is found by examining the vocabulary that you have been tested on, comparing them to the appropriate databases, and determining your number of correct responses. For example, if you have taken the CAVO Chinese-English test enough times to encounter 100 level 1 words, and 75 of those words are also in the HSK database, then your HSK bar will show the percentage correct of those 75 level 1 HSK vocabulary words. These comparisons can give you an indication of how familiar you are with the vocabulary of the Chinese standardized tests.</p>
